# QuadrupedFootEndTrajectory
## Foot End Trajectory of Quadruped Robot
* The code in this repository provides stop-motion animation of foot trajectory in sagittal plane of quadruped robots.     
* If you want to deploy it in your project, you can change the corresponding variables in the code according to the mechanical structure parameters of your robot. 
* Where, the code of the inverse kinematics solution is as follows:
